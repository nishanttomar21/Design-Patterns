 TODO [Design Principles vs Design Patterns]:

 Design Principles are high-level guidelines and best practices that help developers make good design decisions when creating software systems. They provide abstract rules and recommendations to follow during development. Design principles focus on the "why" behind the design choices.
 Some key design principles include:
    Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change
    Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
    Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
    Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use
    Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions

 Design Patterns, on the other hand, are specific, reusable solutions to commonly occurring design problems. They provide concrete templates and guidelines for addressing recurring issues in software design. Design patterns focus on the "how" by offering well-established solutions.
 Some popular design patterns include:
    Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance
    Factory: Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass
    Adapter: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect
    Decorator: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects by wrapping them

 In summary, design principles are abstract guidelines that help create maintainable, extensible software, while design patterns are concrete solutions to specific design problems. Principles provide the theory, while patterns offer the practical implementation techniques.
