// Eg: PubG Bullets
// Split Bullet class into intrinsic(remain same across all objects) and extrinsic(value of which might change across all objects) classes to reduce the space utilising
// The Flyweight design pattern is a structural pattern that optimizes memory usage by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all the data in each object. It's particularly useful when dealing with a large number of similar objects.
// Intrinsic State: This is the data that is specific to each object and cannot be shared. It represents the unique properties of an object.
// Extrinsic State: This is the data that can be shared between multiple objects. It often represents contextual information that can be passed to the object during usage.
// Benefits: Reduced Memory Usage, Improved Performance, Efficient Object Sharing
