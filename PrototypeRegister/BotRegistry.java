// Registry: Saving all the templates/types of Bots
// The Registry design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a centralized place to store and access instances of classes or objects. This pattern is useful for managing a global object registry where objects can be retrieved by name or identifier. The Registry pattern helps avoid the problems associated with using global variables by providing a controlled access point for these objects.
// Benefits: Centralized Access, Controlled Global State, Decoupling
